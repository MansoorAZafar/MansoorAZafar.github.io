                    </div>
                    <h3>Maze Builder/Solver</h3>

                    <p>JavaFX-based interactive tool where you design custom mazes and watch algorithms solve them in real time. The application features a user-friendly interface for maze creation and a separate screen for visualization of the solving process.</p>

                    <p> This was built with a combination of JavaFX for the GUI and various pathfinding algorithms implemented in C++. </p>

                    <p> This was built with a partner, who took care of the C++ implementation while I focused on the JavaFX front-end. This language split allowed our program to be faster, as we could optimize each part independently, while also playing to our individual strengths.</p>

                    <h3>Space Shooter Game</h3>
                    <p>Java Swing-based 2D space shooter game where you control a spaceship and shoot down an enemy ship. The game is bullet hell style with only one enemy ship on the screen at a time. It features multiple difficulty levels and a game history system.</p>
                    <p> This was built with Java Swing for the GUI and uses a game loop on a different thread to handle the game logic and rendering. The game history system is implemented using a simple file-based storage system.</p>
                    <p> This was built by myself for a school project, focusing on object-oriented programming principles. This was actually my first ever coding project, and as a result, it holds a special place in my portfolio.</p>

                    <h3>Parking Lot System</h3>
                    <p>Java Swing-based parking lot management system that allows managers to manage parking spaces and track vehicle entries and exits. Users can also login, allowing them to book, cancel, and manage their parking reservations.</p>
                    <p> This was built with Java Swing for the GUI and uses CSV files for the database management. The project was designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.</p>
                    <p> This was built with a team for a school project, where I developed the code structure and implemented the user login functionality, while my team helped with the other parts of the implementation and front-end design.</p>
